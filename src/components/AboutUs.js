        <h5>Key Challenges and Our Approach:</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            **Reinventing the Wheel**: We streamline testing processes by creating reusable assets and frameworks 
            to eliminate redundancies and maximize efficiency.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Lack of Collaboration Tools**: By implementing centralized tools and best practices, we enable teams 
            to share and reuse testing assets effectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Resource Allocation**: Our structured approach ensures skilled testers are utilized effectively, balancing 
            innovation with ongoing operations.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Continuous Improvement**: We establish consistent processes to enable regular assessments and 
            identify areas for optimization.
          </li>
